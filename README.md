#  Arabic Image Captioning 

**Bridging the Gap Between Vision and Language in Arabic!**

## Project Overview 

Imagine a world where machines can not only see but also understand and describe what they see in Arabicâ€”one of the most beautiful and complex languages! This project is a groundbreaking step toward that vision. It generates **Arabic captions** for input images using advanced deep learning techniques, enabling seamless integration into applications like:

* **Accessibility tools** for visually impaired Arabic speakers
* **Cultural preservation** by creating content in the Arabic language
* **Multimedia translation** for social media and entertainment

## ðŸ›  Technical Highlights

* **Encoder**: EfficientNetB0 Convolutional Neural Network
* **Decoder**: LSTM with advanced attention mechanism
* **Dataset**: Flickr8k (custom Arabic translation)
* **Evaluation**: BLEU Score metric
