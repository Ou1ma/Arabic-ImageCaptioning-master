🌟 Arabic Image Captioning 🌟
Bridging the Gap Between Vision and Language in Arabic!

🚀 Project Overview
Imagine a world where machines can not only see but also understand and describe what they see in Arabic—one of the most beautiful and complex languages! This project is a groundbreaking step toward that vision. It generates Arabic captions for input images using advanced deep learning techniques, enabling seamless integration into applications like:

Accessibility tools for visually impaired Arabic speakers.
Cultural preservation by creating content in the Arabic language.
Multimedia translation for social media and entertainment.
"An image is worth a thousand words—now in Arabic!"
